Located little inland from Nuweiba, it is probably the most visited sight in the Sinai interior after St. Katherine, but you can still find peace and quiet at this beautiful spot. Most groups arrive by 4×4 tours mid-morning, so you could visit the canyon early morning or late afternoon without the crowds. A lodge is located at the rim of the plateau above the canyon, and a cafeteria at another point where the hike usually finishes. The 4×4 track to the Coloured Canyon starts at the little oasis of Ein Furtaga, located next to the asphalt road in Wadi Watir.

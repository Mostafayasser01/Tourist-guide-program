The Blue Hole is one of the most famous diving spots in Sinai, found near Dahab. It is submarine sinkhole, around 130 m (462.5 feet) deep. There is a shallow opening around 6 m deep, known as “the saddle”, opening out to the sea, and a 26 m long tunnel, known as “the arch”, whose top is at a depth of 56 m (184 feet). The hole and the surrounding area have an abundance of coral and reef fish. There is a local legend that the Blue Hole is cursed by the ghost of a girl who drowned herself there to escape from an arranged marriage.

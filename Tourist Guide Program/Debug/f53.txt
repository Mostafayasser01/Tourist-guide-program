
If you have time for only one day trip from Aswan, pick a visit to Abu Simbel. Built by Ramses II, and saved from destruction by a remarkable UNESCO rescue project in the 1970s, Abu Simbel is not only a triumph of ancient architecture, but also of modern engineering. The mammoth scale of the Great Temple of Ramses II and the Temple of Hathor, sitting on the banks of Lake Nasser, trumps everything else in Egypt and has to be seen to be believed.

Most people come to Abu Simbel by tour. This private Abu Simbel minibus tour transports you by minibus to the temples and includes entry and tours of both temples with an Egyptologist guide. If you're shorter on time, or simply don't fancy the four-hour road trip there and back, this private Abu Simbel tour with flights includes return flight from Aswan to Abu Simbel, temple entrance fees, and a guided tour of both temples with an Egyptologist guide.

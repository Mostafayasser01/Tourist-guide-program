The Giftun Islands are one of Hurghada's most popular boat excursions, with prime swaths of white sand to soak up the rays, and snorkeling opportunities galore on offer. For those who aren't scuba diving enthusiasts, the easily accessed coral reefs surrounding the island shore are an excellent taster of the Red Sea's beauty. Snorkeling or even just paddling close to shore, you can spot plenty of fish life flitting through the clear water. Those not interested in underwater exploits can simply claim a palm-frond shelter on the beach, sit back, and enjoy the sun.

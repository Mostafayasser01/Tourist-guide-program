Ras Mohammed National Park is what put Sharm el-Sheikh on the tourist map. Surrounded by some of the world's most incredible dive sites, this peninsula is home to glorious beaches with excellent snorkeling just offshore, the world's second most northerly mangrove forest, and a saltwater lake. A trip here is a must-do for anyone staying in Sharm el-Sheikh. The best beaches are Old Quay Beach (with its top-notch coral reef easily reached from the shore) and Aqaba Beach.

Travelers seeking a good view should head to the Shark Observatory cliff top right on the southern edge of Ras Mohammed, where views stretch across both sides of the Red Sea.

Located near the resort city of Sharm el Sheikh, Ras Mohamed was the first National Park in the Sinai. It is famous for its underwater life and coral reefs, and so is usually visited for snorkeling and scuba diving, either by car or boat. It is a pleasant spot even if you are not into water sports. It is the southernmost point of the Sinai Peninsula and there are a number of beaches in little cute bays, as well as lookout points. Most tour operators organise programs to Ras Mohamed.

Hurghada Marina is a rather swish and modern addition to the central district of Sigala and the town's major dining destination. At sunset, this is the place to promenade while soaking up the last of the evening light before heading to one of the many cafés or restaurants for a meal. Dining with views over the bobbing yachts and the Red Sea stretching to the horizon can't be beaten.

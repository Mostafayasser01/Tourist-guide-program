If you don't want to get your feet wet, this tourist submarine — the only one operating on the Red Sea — takes passengers down to a depth of 22 meters under the water for a peek at the Red Sea's abundant coral and fish life, all without even putting a toe in the sea. Trips take about one hour, and although they don't go very far offshore where the better coral can be viewed, for non-swimmers, it provides an opportunity to see the magical world below the surface.

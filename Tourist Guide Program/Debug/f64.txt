Jolanda Reef (also called Yolanda Reef) is one of the most popular dive sites in the northern section of the Red Sea and lies within the Ras Mohammed Marine Park. Divers flock here to explore the remains of the Jolanda, an old Cypriot freighter ship that ran aground in 1980. It's more than just a wreck dive though, as Jolanda Reef also encompasses the coral walls of Shark Reef with its huge numbers of fish life and enchanting coral gardens.

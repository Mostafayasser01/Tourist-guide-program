Hurghada's best patches of sand have all been claimed by the shore-side resorts that stretch along the coast on both sides of town. Even if you're not staying in one of the hotels, nearly all of the resorts offer day access to non-guests. To really sample Hurghada's beach life though, you should book yourself in for a few nights of resort living.

The best beaches lie south of the main town area (called Sigala) in the unimaginatively named "Resort Strip." Travel a bit farther south, and you get to the area known as Sahl Hasheesh, which is home to some of the Red Sea coastline's prime pieces of white-sand beach and best hotels.

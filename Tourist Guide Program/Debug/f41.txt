A re-imagining of Alexandria's ancient Great Library, this gorgeously designed cultural center contains a host of museums, as well as one of the modern world's most ambitious libraries. Its architecture — a giant sun disk — presides over the waterfront Corniche, while inside, a huge reading room can hold eight million volumes.

Below the main library, visitors can explore a range of beautifully curated exhibitions. The Manuscript Museum, with its magnificent collection of ancient texts and scrolls, and the Antiquities Museum, with its Greco-Roman antiquities and statuary found during underwater exploration in the harbor, are the two prime attractions. But there are also rotating art exhibitions, a permanent Egyptian folk art collection, and a Science Museum and Planetarium that are aimed squarely at children.

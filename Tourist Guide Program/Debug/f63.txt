Fringed by a white-sand beach and swaying palm trees, Naama Bay is the epicenter of Sharm el-Sheikh's resort life. There are plentiful restaurants, cafés, and souvenir stores if you get bored of the sand, but Naama Bay is really all about the beach. A pedestrian-only promenade rims the entire beach area, backed by a cluster of luxury resorts. For those looking for a holiday full of sloth-like sunbathing, Naama Bay is one of Egypt's top choices. The entire beach area has excellent facilities, including ample sun-shades and loungers, and the beachside cafés mean you don't even have to move from your patch of sandy bliss all day.

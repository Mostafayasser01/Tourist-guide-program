For many advanced divers, a trip to Sharm el-Sheikh means only one thing: diving the Thistlegorm. One of the top wreck dives in the world, this ship packed full of cargo to resupply British troops was sunk during World War II by German bombers. Fish now flit through its rooms and cargo holds filled with jeeps, motorbikes, and armaments that never made it to the front. The wreck is situated in the Straits of Gubal, off the western coast of the Sinai Peninsula, so it is offered as either a long one-day boat trip from Sharm el-Sheikh or an overnight trip. All boat tours here offer at least two dives of the wreck plus a stop at one of Ras Mohammed's dive sites. The overnight trips have the added bonus of a night dive of the wreck.
